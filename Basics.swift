//? Swift provides many fundamental data types, 
//! Including Int for integers, Double for floating-point values, Bool for Boolean values, and String for text. 

//! Constants and Variables
//? The value of a constant can’t be changed once it’s set, whereas a variable can be set to a different value in the future
//? Constants and variables must be declared before they’re used. You declare constants with the let keyword and variables with the var keyword
//? Here’s an example of how constants and variables can be used to track the number of login attempts a user has made:

let name = "Mansi";
var Sname = "Mahant";

print(name);
print(Sname);
